XBMC <-> mpd interface

Pause mpd playback prior to launching XBMC playback and then resume upon completion
of XBMC playback.

Allows mpd to be used for streaming or music library playback while XBMC screensaver
is running and full sound from the XBMC media center when requested. 

Note: This has not been updated for the v6 API (XBMC 12.0 Frodo).  It is compatible
with API v4 and the HTTP Interface.
